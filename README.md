# Black-Litterman Portfolio Optimization Model

## Description
In this repository I have written C++ code which imports a set of stocks and utilizes the Black-Litterman Portfolio Optimization model to calcuate how much to invest into each stock. The model uses initial weights and assumptions about each stocks performance inputted by the user of the model and analyzes them to generate appropriate portfolio allocations to each stock. This model uses linear algebra heavily.
